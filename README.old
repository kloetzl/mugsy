See README.install for installation

To run 

%bash
%source mugsyenv.sh
%mugsy --help

Mugsy generates MAF formatted multiple alignments from FASTA inputs. The
wrapper script 'mugsy' invokes all the steps to calculate the multiple
alignment.

Example invocation
% mugsy --directory /local/scratch --prefix mygenomes genome1.fsa genome2.fsa genome3.fsa

The core executables are

mugsyWGA - whole genome aligner based on Seqan::TCoffee

synchain-mugsy - segmentation program to produce locally collinear
blocks (LCBs) from a set of anchors

nucmer - 3.20 release bundled for convenience with new utility
delta2maf and modified delta-filter to add support for reporting
duplications
