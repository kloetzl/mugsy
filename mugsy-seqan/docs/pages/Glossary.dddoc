..SeqAn: The C++ library for sequence analysis.
...text:You are just reading the documentation of this library. For more information see @http://www.seqan.de@.
...see:Page


..Metafunction: A C++ construct that is used to determine types and constants at compile time.
...see:Page.Metafunctions
...see:Metafunction


..Concept:A kind of interface used in generic programmic that is not formulated in C++ but only a part of the documentation.
...see:Concept


..Template Subclassing:An alternative to inheritance for the refinement of classes that is based on class template specialization.
...see:Page.Template Subclassing


..Specialization:A refinement of a class that was defined using @glos:Template Subclassing@.
...see:Spec


..Tag:A type that acts as a switch when applied as argument to functions or @glos:Metafunction|metafunctions@.
...see:Tag


..Adaption:Functionality that allows to access built-in type or data types from external libraries in the same way as SeqAn classes.
...see:Adaption


..Needle:The sequence that is searched in the @glos:haystack@.
...see:Page.Searching
...see:Concept.Pattern


..Haystack:The sequence that is searched for @glos:needles@. 
...see:Page.Searching
...see:Concept.Finder


..Index:A data structure for faster searching in sequences.
...see:Class.Index
...see:Page.Searching


..Trie:A tree shaped automaton.
...see:Spec.Trie


..Alignment:An arrangement of two or more sequences: Each character is connected to at most one character for each other sequence,
and that the characters in each sequence are ordered in the same way as the connected characters in other sequences.
...see:Class.Align
...see:Spec.Alignment Graph
...see:Page.Alignments


..Scoring Scheme:A rule for calculating the similarity between two values or between a value and a @glos:blank@.
...text:@glos:Scoring schemes@ are used for @Page.Searching|searching@ and @Page.Alignments|aligning@.In SeqAn, @glos:scoring schemes@ are stored in @Class.Score|score objects@, 
e.g. @Spec.Simple Score@ or @Spec.Pam@.
...see:Class.Score
...see:Page.Scoring


..Affine Gap Costs:A scoring scheme that defines the score for a gap of length $n$ as $gap_open + (n-1)* gap_extend$.
...see:Page.Scoring
...see:glos:Scoring Scheme
...see:glos:Linear Gap Costs

..Linear Gap Costs:A scoring scheme that defines the score for a gap to be proportional to the length of the gap.
...see:Page.Scoring
...see:glos:Scoring Scheme


..Blank:One position within a @glos:gap@ area of an alignment. 
...description:The typical printout of an alignment uses a dash sign (i.e. a "-") to visualize a blank.


..Gap:A part of an @glos:alignment@ in which characters of one sequence are not aligned to characters of the other sequence.
...description:A gap consists out of one or more @glos:blanks@.
