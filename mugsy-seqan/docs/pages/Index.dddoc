..title:SeqAn - The Library for Sequence Analysis - Documentation
.Indexpage.Page.description:
..text:SeqAn is the open source C++ library of efficient algorithms and data structures for the analysis of sequences with the focus on biological data.
..text:SeqAn applies a unique generic design that guarantees high performance, generality, extensibility, and integration with other libraries.
..text:SeqAn is easy to use and simplifies the development of new software tools with a minimal loss of performance.

..section:# Getting Started
..text:Follow the @Page.Installation|installation instructions@ to install SeqAn on your system.
..text:A good starting point for learning more about SeqAn is to read the tutorials, which are listed at the end of this page.
    This will introduce you into the basic concepts of the library and give you an overview about the content of the library.
..text:Refer to the @Page.Glossary|glossary@ if you encounter questionable terminology.
..text:The @Demo|collection of example programs@ demonstrate how to use the data structures and functions offered by SeqAn.
 Find instructions for the installation of the library and how to use the example programs @Page.Installation|here@.    
..text:For more information about SeqAn visit the SeqAn homepage @http://www.seqan.de|www.seqan.de@.

..table:@Function|Functions@|Global functions that work on data structures.
..table:@Metafunction|Metafunctions@|@glos:Metafunction|Metafunctions@ that are used to determine depending types or constants depending on given types or constants at compile time.
..table:@Tag|Tags@|Special types that are used as switches when passed to functions.
..table:@Adaption|Adaption@|Built-in types and classes of other libraries that can be accessed the same way as SeqAn datastructures.
..table:@Demo|Examples@|Small programs that demonstrates the application of SeqAn functionality.
